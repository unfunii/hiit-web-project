## Key features

### Key Feature Name/Description.
Pre-Designed Workouts
Users can choose from a variety of pre-designed HIIT workouts targeting specific body parts such as arms, abdomen, legs, etc. Each workout consists of a list of exercises, complete with descriptions. Every exercise is timed for one minute, accompanied by a timer on the screen to help users track the time left for each exercise.

Custom Workout Creator
In addition to the pre-designed workouts, the app features a Custom Workout Creator. This allows users to build their own workouts by choosing from a library of exercises. Similar to the pre-designed workouts, each exercise in the custom workout also lasts for one minute. This feature gives users the flexibility to tailor their workouts according to their specific fitness needs and preferences.

Exercise Timer
Each exercise, whether in a pre-designed or custom workout, is strictly timed at one minute. The app includes an on-screen timer that counts down the minute, helping users maintain the intensity and duration required for HIIT effectively. This feature ensures that workouts are both challenging and time-efficient, making the most of each session.
Workout Control Buttons: Start, Stop, Restart
To enhance user control during workouts, the app includes three key buttons: Start, Stop, and Restart. These allow for greater flexibility during exercise sessions.
Start Button: Begins the workout or resumes it after a pause.
Stop Button: Users can pause their workout at any time if they need a break. Since there's no designated rest time between exercises, this feature is particularly useful for managing fatigue and ensuring users can exercise at their own pace.
Restart Button: This allows users to completely restart their workout from the beginning if they wish to redo it or if they feel they could improve their performance from the start.



### Key Another Feature Name/Description.
How to Use
Choose a Workout: Select a pre-designed workout based on the body part you want to focus on or create your own custom workout by choosing specific exercises.
Start Exercising: Follow the on-screen prompts and the timer to complete each exercise for one minute.
Track Your Progress: Review your performance after each workout to monitor your improvement and adjust your fitness goals accordingly.


### Final Key Feature Name/Description.
The design of your HIIT workout app is strategically tailored to enhance user engagement and ease of use. It features a clean, minimalist aesthetic with a blue and white color scheme that helps reduce visual clutter and focuses the user's attention on the essential elements. Large, bold fonts are used to ensure readability during physical activity, and a consistent layout across different screens aids in intuitive navigation. Interactive elements like large clickable areas are designed for ease of use during workouts, accommodating quick and imprecise interactions. Overall, the design is focused on providing a seamless, user-friendly experience that encourages regular use and supports users in achieving their fitness goals effectively.


## AI
REMOVE ME: Detail your use of AI, listing of the prompts you used, and whether the results formed or inspired part of your final submission and where we can see this (and if not, why not?). You may wish to group prompts into headings/sections - use markdown in any way that it helps you communicate your use of AI. 

### Prompts to develop Targeted Exercise Lists
A sequence of prompts helped me develop the feature for compiling a list of exercises for different body 
parts, each lasting one minute:
>  "Generate a list of exercises for a full-body HIIT workout."
The response was too general and not focused on the requirement that each exercise should last exactly one minute, which is crucial for the HIIT format.


>  "List exercises targeting specific body parts that each last exactly one minute for a HIIT workout."
The refinement made in the prompt led to a more usable list, categorising exercises by body part and ensuring each fits the one-minute duration requirement

>  “How can I ensure that these one-minute exercises are balanced in terms of difficulty and effectiveness?”
The AI’s suggestion included guidelines on how to balance the workout intensity across different exercises,
which we integrated to optimise the user’s training experience
